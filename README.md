# Extracting-meta-data-out-of-books

Conveyor belt mechanism for our extraction of meta data from book.

So to make this process work we all  made small codes that will make overall metadata of the book. And by this metadata we will seperate the book to different buckets and do extractions of questions and answers based on the metadata and bucket.


The metadata that is to be extracted from a book are.
1. Name of book
2. Authour or publisher 
3. Language type -English or Hindi 
4. Image based pdf or simple pdf ( need to know which extractions library to be used OCR or pypdf)
5. If content present then detail of begining and ending page ( to find from which page the question start)
6. Is answer are with questions or are at separate page.
7. Topic covered in the books.
8. Do exam year mentioned or not 
9. Content type - questions or other 
10. Do it has image based questions or not
